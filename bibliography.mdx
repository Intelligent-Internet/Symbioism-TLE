# Bibliography

This work is an act of synthesis, drawing upon foundational texts from economics, physics, computer science, history, and philosophy. This bibliography is offered not just as a list of citations, but as a guide for further inquiry into the intellectual pillars that inform its arguments.

## Part I: The Economic Canon & Its Critics

- **Coase, Ronald H.** "The Nature of the Firm." _Economica_, vol. 4, no. 16, 1937, pp. 386–405.  
  Coase's revolutionary concept of "transaction costs" provides the classical explanation for the existence of the firm. In **Chapter 11**, we reframe this insight through the lens of information processing, arguing the firm is an "engine for execution" that minimizes the computational costs of market discovery.
- **Graeber, David.** _Bullshit Jobs: A Theory_. Simon & Schuster, 2018\.  
  Graeber's essential work provides the sociological evidence for the "Meaning Crisis" discussed in **Chapter 4** and the "unbundling of work" at the core of **Chapter 22**. It demonstrates that the old paradigm was already failing to provide purpose long before the Intelligence Inversion.
- **Hayek, Friedrich A.** "The Use of Knowledge in Society." _The American Economic Review_, vol. 35, no. 4, 1945, pp. 519–30.  
  Hayek's seminal essay on the price system as a mechanism for coordinating dispersed knowledge is the definitive description of what we identify in **Chapter 9** as **Harmonic Flow**, the emergent, structural channels of trust and information that underpin a complex society.
- **Keynes, John Maynard.** _The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money_. Macmillan, 1936\.  
  The foundational text of modern macroeconomics. We critique its framework as the pinnacle of the "mechanistic" paradigm, a system of levers and dials that our model of **Policy as Geometry Engineering** seeks to replace.
- **Keynes, John Maynard.** "Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren." _Essays in Persuasion_, 1930\.  
  This astonishingly prescient essay, which foresaw the psychological challenges of a world of abundance, provides the opening frame for our exploration of a post-scarcity world in **Chapter 22: After Economics**.
- **Kuznets, Simon.** "National Income, 1929–1932". _73rd US Congress, 2d session, Senate document no. 124_, 1934\.  
  Kuznets created GDP while personally warning against its use as a measure of welfare. His prescient critique is the foundation for our argument in **Chapter 4: The Dashboard for Insanity** and the primary motivation for developing the **MIND Dashboard**.
- **Lee, Kai-Fu.** _AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order_. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018\.  
  Lee's definitive geopolitical analysis of the US-China AI race describes the central dynamic that we identify in **Chapter 16** as the path toward the **Great Fragmentation** future.
- **Lucas, Robert E., Jr.** "Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique." _Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy_, vol. 1, 1976, pp. 19-46.  
  The Nobel-winning paper that devastated mechanistic macroeconomic modeling. We propose in **Chapter 13** that the **Dual Engine** model is the first complete, mechanistic solution to the Lucas Critique.
- **Marx, Karl.** _Das Kapital, Volume 1_. 1867\.  
  Marx's foundational critique of capital's self-amplifying nature provides a perfect description of what we identify in **Chapter 9** as **Circular Flow**, the self-reinforcing, accumulative dynamic of non-rivalrous assets.
- **Perez, Carlota.** _Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital: The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages_. Edward Elgar Publishing, 2002\.  
  Perez's essential work on the cyclical nature of technological revolutions informs our argument in **Chapter 13** that the Intelligence Inversion breaks this historical pattern, collapsing the "installation" and "deployment" phases into a single, permanent transition.
- **Piketty, Thomas.** _Capital in the Twenty-First Century_. Translated by Arthur Goldhammer, Belknap Press, 2014\.  
  Piketty's landmark empirical study of inequality identified the symptom (_r \> g_). In **Chapter 10**, we provide a physical diagnosis, arguing that _r_ represents the exponential returns of **Circular Flow** and *g*the linear returns of **Gradient Flow**.
- **Sahlins, Marshall.** _Stone Age Economics_. Aldine Transaction, 1972\.  
  Sahlins's concept of the "original affluent society" provides the historical and anthropological precedent for the post-economic world we explore in **Chapter 22**, challenging the myth that humanity is naturally condemned to ceaseless labor.
- **Smith, Adam.** _An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations_. 1776\.  
  The foundational text of classical economics. In **Chapter 9**, we reposition Smith's "invisible hand" as a brilliant description of **Gradient Flow**, the competitive exchange of scarce, rivalrous goods.
- **Zuboff, Shoshana.** _The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power_. PublicAffairs, 2019\.  
  Zuboff provides the definitive chronicle of the extractive economic logic that we position as the final, most perfected business model of the Third Economic Inversion, the paradigm that is now ending.

## Part II: AI, Alignment, and the Future of Intelligence

- **Bostrom, Nick.** _Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies_. Oxford University Press, 2014\.  
  Bostrom's foundational work on long-term existential risk from AGI informs our argument in **Chapter 14**, where we reframe his philosophical "control problem" as the immediate, practical challenge of the **Alignment Economy**.
- **Suleyman, Mustafa.** _The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century's Greatest Dilemma_. Crown, 2023\.  
  Suleyman's insider perspective on the immense challenge of "containing" new technologies highlights the problem that our proposal for a **Symbiotic State** is designed to solve, arguing that simple containment is insufficient.

## Part III: Physics, Complexity, and Information Theory

- **Barabási, Albert-László.** _Linked: How Everything Is Connected to Everything Else and What It Means for Business, Science, and Everyday Life_. Basic Books, 2002\.  
  Barabási's accessible introduction to network science provides the scientific basis for our analysis of **Network Topology** and power-law dynamics in **Chapter 10: The Network Prison**.
- **Prigogine, Ilya, and Isabelle Stengers.** _Order Out of Chaos: Man's New Dialogue with Nature_. Bantam Books, 1984\.  
  This Nobel laureate's work on thermodynamics and self-organizing systems provides the core physical metaphor for our entire framework, particularly the fundamental struggle between intelligence and entropy outlined in **Chapter 6**.
- **Shannon, Claude E.** "A Mathematical Theory of Communication." _The Bell System Technical Journal_, vol. 27, 1948, pp. 379-423.  
  The founding document of information theory, providing the mathematical language necessary to understand the "Bit Economy," the physics of **Intelligence Capital**, and the dynamics of non-rivalrous goods.
- **Taleb, Nassim Nicholas.** _Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder_. Random House, 2012\.  
  Taleb's crucial concept of antifragility informs our framework's emphasis on resilience. We argue in **Chapter 8** that **Diversity Capital (D)** is the key structural property that allows a system to become antifragile.

## Part IV: Philosophy, History, and Governance

- **Frankl, Viktor E.** _Man's Search for Meaning_. Beacon Press, 1959\.  
  Frankl's profound work on finding purpose in the face of suffering is cited in **Chapter 22** as a vital guide for the coming challenge of finding purpose in a world of frictionless ease.
- **Gatto, John Taylor.** _Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling_. New Society Publishers, 1992\.  
  Gatto's critique of the modern education system provides key historical context for our concept of the **Factory School** in **Chapter 3**.
- **Hobbes, Thomas.** _Leviathan_. 1651\.
- **Locke, John.** _Two Treatises of Government_. 1689\.
- **Rousseau, Jean-Jacques.** _The Social Contract_. 1762\.  
  These three foundational texts of modern political philosophy are analyzed in **Chapter 14** as the architects of a social contract built for an obsolete world of scarcity.
- **Ostrom, Elinor.** _Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action_. Cambridge University Press, 1990\.  
  Ostrom's Nobel-winning work provides powerful, real-world evidence for the viability of decentralized, symbiotic governance models, which are a cornerstone of our blueprint for a new world. Her work is a practical demonstration of **Harmonic Flow**.
- **Rawls, John.** _A Theory of Justice_. Harvard University Press, 1971\.  
  Rawls's "veil of ignorance" thought experiment provides the explicit ethical framework used in **Chapter 14** to derive the principles of the **New Social Contract** from first principles of fairness.
